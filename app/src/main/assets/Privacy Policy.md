## Privacy Policy

First and foremost, Simple Markdown DOES NOT collect any personally identifiable information. The
internet access permission is requested primarily for retrieving images from the internet in 
case you embed them in your markdown, but it also allows me to send automated error and crash 
reports to myself whenever the app runs into an issue. These automated reports are powered by my own
self-hosted version of [Sentry] (https://sentry.io/), which is a free and open source error
reporting solution. These error reports are used exclusively for fixing problems that occur while 
you're using the app. For more information on the kinds of data that may be sent in these automated 
error reports, please see the [relevant documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/#context)
on Sentry's website. If you would like to opt-out of these error reports, please visit the in-app
settings page to disable the toggle for error reports.
